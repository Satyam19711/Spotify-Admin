# ⚙️ Spotify Admin Panel  

The **Spotify Admin Panel** is the backend management dashboard for the full-stack Spotify app.  
It allows the admin to **add, manage, and delete songs or albums** that appear in the user app.  
The admin interface is built using **React (Vite)** and connects to a **Node.js + MongoDB backend** via RESTful APIs.
